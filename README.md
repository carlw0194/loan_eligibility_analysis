# üìä Loan Eligibility Analysis Dashboard

This project explores historical loan application data to uncover key factors influencing loan approvals. By combining data preparation, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and dashboard design, the project aims to provide financial institutions with a transparent, interactive tool for assessing loan eligibility. It is designed as a portfolio-worthy, end-to-end data analysis solution.

## üîç Project Objectives

- Understand which applicant attributes (e.g., income, credit history, dependents) most influence loan approval decisions.
- Clean and prepare real-world loan application data for analysis and modeling.
- Engineer new features such as total income, income per dependent, and debt-to-income ratio to improve analytical depth.
- Build a dashboard that communicates findings clearly to non-technical stakeholders.
- Train and evaluate a Random Forest classifier to predict loan approvals with feature importance analysis.
- Export enriched data with predictions and confidence scores for comprehensive Power BI visualization.

## üí° Business Questions Answered

1. **Who is more likely to be approved for a loan?**
   ‚Üí Based on credit history, income, dependents, and property area.

2. **How do applicant attributes affect approval rates?**
   ‚Üí Visual breakdowns by gender, education, credit history, etc.

3. **What role does income play in eligibility?**
   ‚Üí Analysis of total income, loan amount ratios, and dependents.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Module

### Model Selection & Rationale

**Random Forest Classifier** was chosen for loan approval prediction because:

- **Interpretability**: Provides clear feature importance rankings for business insights
- **Robustness**: Handles mixed data types (numerical and categorical) effectively
- **Performance**: Excellent baseline performance with minimal hyperparameter tuning
- **Feature Relationships**: Captures non-linear relationships and feature interactions

### Key Features Used

- **Original Attributes**: Credit history, loan amount, income, education, demographics
- **Engineered Features**: Total income, income-per-dependent, EMI-to-income ratio, debt ratios
- **Missing Value Indicators**: Flags for originally missing data points

### Model Performance

- **Cross-validation accuracy**: ~80%+ (varies by data split)
- **Feature Importance**: Credit history and engineered income ratios are top predictors
- **Export**: All predictions include confidence scores for risk assessment
